## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

### What we want it to do

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
   1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
   1. And this will be done programatically
3. Uing Chainlink VRF && Chainlink Automation
   1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
   2. Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger

### Test !

1. write some deploy scripts
2. write our tests
   1. work on local chain
   2. forked testnet
   3. forked mainnet
